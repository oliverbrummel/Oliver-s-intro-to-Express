# Lambda-Weekend-Assignment

Your assignment this weekend will be to use the OMDBApi to query three different movies that have had an impact on your life. You will do three seperate queries, grabbing information for each movie and appending it to the screen. Each of these elements should be styled and presented in a way that reflects the things that we've learned about CSS in the past week.

This will be used as a catalyst for our speeches next week, so be ready to talk about the movies!
